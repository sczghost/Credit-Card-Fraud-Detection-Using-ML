# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using **Machine Learning algorithms**. With the growing use of online transactions, fraudulent activities have also increased. Detecting fraud in real-time is critical to ensure financial security and maintain customer trust.

In this project, we apply and compare different ML algorithms on the **Kaggle Credit Card Dataset**, balance the data using **SMOTE**, and evaluate models using multiple performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * Pandas, NumPy → Data Handling
  * Scikit-learn → ML Models & Evaluation
  * XGBoost → Gradient Boosting Classifier
  * Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) → Handling Class Imbalance
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data Visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset

* Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
* **Rows:** 284,807
* **Features:** 30 (including `Time`, `Amount`, PCA transformed features `V1…V28`)
* **Target:**

  * `0` → Legitimate Transaction
  * `1` → Fraudulent Transaction

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Script

```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

---

## 📊 Results

* **Before Balancing:** Models struggled due to class imbalance.
* **After SMOTE Balancing:**

  * Logistic Regression → Accuracy: \~95%, ROC-AUC: 0.98
  * Decision Tree → Accuracy: \~98%, ROC-AUC: 0.99
  * XGBoost → Accuracy: \~99.9%, ROC-AUC: 1.0 ✅ (Best Performer)

📈 The **XGBoost Classifier** achieved the **highest accuracy and robustness**, making it the best model for fraud detection.

---

## 📌 Future Scope

* Deploy as a **REST API** for real-time fraud detection
* Use **Deep Learning (ANN/LSTM)** for sequence-based detection
* Integrate with **cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
* Improve with **Ensemble Models** for better generalization
